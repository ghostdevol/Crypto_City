# 🤝 Contributing to Crypto_City

Crypto_City is a modular, faction-driven Ethereum explorer. Contributions are welcome—but must respect the project's forensic integrity and creative autonomy.

## 🧠 Guidelines
- Fork the repo and submit pull requests with clear descriptions
- All dApps must be sandboxed and wallet-authenticated
- No scammy, deceptive, or honeypot logic allowed
- Respect the GhostDevol license and attribution rules

## 🧩 Areas to Contribute
- New faction overlays and analytics panels
- DApp registry enhancements (GraphQL, IPFS, etc.)
- UI polish and post-processing effects
- Modular gameplay mechanics tied to wallet state

## 🔐 Security
If you discover a vulnerability, report it privately to ghostdevol@protonmail.com. Do not disclose publicly until patched.

## 🧼 Code Style
- C# scripts should be modular and extensible
- Use UnityEvents or ScriptableObjects for clean decoupling
- Follow Unity naming conventions and avoid hardcoded logic
